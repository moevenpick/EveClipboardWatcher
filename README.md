PVP helper for D-scan and local chat

Use CTRL+A and CTRL-C in 
D-Scan Window and then in
Local Chat Character Window (your username must be in the selection).

Then it will show you possible targets. The ships are categorized from A to D. A means the kill/loss ratio from your ship to the ship in question is low. D means the ship in question has more kills than deaths agains your ship type.

The pilots are matched to the ship if he has killed in that shiptype in the last hour. It also shows if the kill was solo or in a group.

Press the ship tool button if you changed your vessel. Then a new database for the new vessel is building up.

Loading the static data takes about 1-2 minutes.
